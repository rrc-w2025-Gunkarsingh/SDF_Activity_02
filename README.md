# Intermediate Software Development Activity 2

This activity will help to reinforce learning of the Module 2 concepts of:

- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Package Initialization

## Additional Information

 - Implementation of abstract classes and methods.
- Validation of data using exception handling.
- Unit testing for class functionality.

## Additional Information
- Implemented Abstraction by using an abstract Shape class with abstract methods for area and perimeter calculations.
- Used Inheritance to create subclasses like Triangle and Rectangle that extend the Shape superclass.
- Applied package Initialization so that all shape classes can be imported easily using from shape import .

Inheritance
- Created a base Shape class with common attributes and methods.
- Developed Triangle and Rectangle subclasses that inherit from Shape and implement specific functionality.     

Polymorphism
- Overrode abstract methods in subclasses to provide specific implementations for area and perimeter calculations.
